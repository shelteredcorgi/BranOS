# BranOS 🖥️
### *A nostalgic web-based workspace built for focused productivity*

**When endless browser tabs and notifications kill your creativity, BranOS brings back the focused, distraction-free computing experience of the early 2000s — with modern power under the hood.**

## 🎯 **Why I Built This**

As a social media manager, I was drowning in digital chaos. Slack notifications, 47 browser tabs, constant context switching between tools. I needed a dedicated workspace that felt like the focused computing days of my childhood, but with all the modern tools I actually need.

So I built my own operating system. In the browser.

## ✨ **What Makes It Special**

### 🎨 **Four Nostalgic Themes**
Switch between **System 7**, **Mac OS X Aqua**, **Windows XP**, and **Windows 98** — complete with authentic fonts, sounds, and animations. Because sometimes you need that Windows XP startup sound to get in the zone.

### 🛠️ **Custom-Built Productivity Tools**

**Memes App** — My secret weapon for social media content
Tag, organize, and batch-edit thousands of images with AI-powered suggestions. Built because existing tools were either too complex or too basic.

**X Lists Integration** — Monitor social media without the chaos
Clean, focused view of Twitter Lists with offline caching. No algorithm, no distractions.

**Videos Player** — Retro-style content research
VCR-inspired YouTube playlist manager for research and inspiration. Because sometimes the best ideas come from old content.

### 📝 **Real Writing Environment**
**TextEdit & Notepad** — Distraction-free writing with markdown support, word goals, and version history. When you need to write campaigns, not fight with formatting.

**To-Do System** — Natural language task management ("tomorrow 3pm") that actually understands how you think.
